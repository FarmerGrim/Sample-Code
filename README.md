# Sample-Code
Some code samples I've written

School Programming projects:
  -360Proj6-VidGame.asm
  -380 GL P3 Racetrack Hummel.cpp
  
The Susan Horak Group:
  -navigation.html-
      Re-worked the navigation buttons of www.susanhorak.com to function as div buttons rather than simply hyperlinks which required clicking on the word rather than the entire "button/div".
      
  -All web pages/templates-
      Changed copyright to a php statement for the current year, including adding timezone to the header.
      
      Updated the favicons from favicon generator site to support more sizes and platforms.
      Made a separate favicons.php file and included it on web pages.
      
  -Floorplan.png logic
  
  -updated about-us page
